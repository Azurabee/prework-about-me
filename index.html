      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Technical Support Manager and have worked the customer support industry for over 15 years. I'm a big time gamer nerd that also enjoys theatre. I have a part time job as a live production operator over at Dad's Garage Theatre in the Old Fourth Ward. I've got two very dumb cat boys named Pyro and Cosmo, and they also enjoy chewing on my computer cables.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, GA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing and watch improv, streaming video games, playing board games and playing dungeons and dragons.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The ultimate dream job is whatever career that can provide me a decent paycheck to buy food.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Decatur, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My previous career I was a Technical Support Manager and managed the API Support team, so I know a few tricks, but I want to further my knowledge in web development, and hopefully change into a more technical career, rather than a customer facing one.</p>
